# py4e-practice

I am currently learning Python - Python for Everyone by Dr. Chuck

Here are some of the examples of programs and stuff I've learned watching this.  I thought it would be useful to practice and keep track of some of the
basics and show what I've learned for future reference and to build skills upon.

Thank you Dr. Chuck!
